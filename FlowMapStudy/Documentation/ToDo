Research:

Acceptable Flows:
	- Determine if flow is acceptable is a better way
		- Currently cannot use a flow that is on the edge of tw odomain boundaries even if the surrounding flows all follow a tight path.
		- Created a checkerboard effect of acceptable flows

Timing analysis of flow map versus straight advection:
	- Amount of time advecting because of bad or no flow
	- Amount of time flowing
	- Time overstepping and reverse stepping versus forward stepping the last domain

Accuracy studies:
	- Particles position differences between flow map interpolation and advection in a single domain. ( domain face to domain face )
	- FTLE of flow mapped particles versus FTLE of traditional advection only particles

Parallelism:
	- Uncover the parallel aspects of the now modified algorithm
	- Data parallel primitive based flow map advection routine
	- Data parallel primitive based build flow map routine
	- ( OpenMP, CUDA, EAVL, etc... )

Insitu Placement of flow map routine in M3D for FTLE analysis
